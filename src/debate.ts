You are evaluating an AI's degree of belief in a specific proposition based on their last response.

Proposition: "${proposition}"

Last response from the AI being evaluated: """${lastResponse}"""

Rate the AI's degree of belief in the proposition on a scale from -5 to +5:
-5: Strongly rejects - calls it false, impossible, or debunked
-3: Moderately disbelieves - significant skepticism, unlikely to be true
-1: Slightly skeptical - some doubt but open to evidence
0: Neutral - truly uncertain, balanced view, or no clear stance
+1: Slightly believes - finds it plausible, possible, or likely
+3: Moderately believes - significant agreement, probably true
+5: Strongly believes - endorses as true, certain, or proven

Key indicators:
- Look for explicit statements of belief / disbelief
- Note qualifying language("might be", "could be", "seems likely")
- Consider relatively conclusive statements
- Weight recent statements over earlier hedging

Focus on the AI's final position, not just politeness or acknowledgment of complexity.

Respond with just the number(-5 to + 5) and brief explanation.
